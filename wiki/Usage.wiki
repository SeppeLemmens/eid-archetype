{{{
mvn jboss:deploy

Configure your Apache front-end server via the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/eid-example.conf` config file:
{{{
<Location /eid-example>
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	ProxyPass ajp://localhost:8009/eid-example
</Location>

<Location /eid-example-admin>
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	ProxyPass ajp://localhost:8009/eid-example-admin
</Location>
}}}

Restart the Apache server via:
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart
}}}

Also make sure that `mod_ssl` has been installed as the application requires SSL.
