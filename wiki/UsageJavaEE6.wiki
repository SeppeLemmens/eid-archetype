Add to `socket-binding-group` of `standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
{{{
<socket-binding name="ajp" port="8009"/>
}}}
Also add to `subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:web:1.0"`
{{{
<connector name="ajp" protocol="AJP/1.3" socket-binding="ajp" scheme="ajp"/>
}}}
Start the standalone configuration via:
{{{
bin/standalone.sh
}}}

Enter the ...-ear directory of the project and deploy the EAR file on the local running JBoss AS via:
{{{
mvn jboss-as:deploy
}}}

Configure your Apache front-end server via the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/eid-example.conf` config file:
{{{
<Location /eid-example>
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	ProxyPass ajp://localhost:8009/eid-example
</Location>

<Location /eid-example-admin>
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	ProxyPass ajp://localhost:8009/eid-example-admin
</Location>
